# Theme: Running out of space

## Fitting things in

* Popular restaurant. You are the Maitre'd and you have to assign diner groups
  to tables.

* Disk drive is getting full. You need to delete some files. But which are vital
  code? Replace drive

* Hospital beds

* Parking space

* Family in a house. Clear up rooms or save for an extension.


## Running

* Smuggling. in space.

* Literally running. Spacewalk race?

* Managing. Space delivery company?

* Creeping/growing tendrils from space


## Space

* Personal space. You have to navigate a crowded street/tube/etc without maxing
  out your proximity meter or anyone elses - otherwise you/they lose it!

* Outer space.

* Inner space. Nano entities inside a body.


## Shrinking environment

* You are defending against enemies that consume the ground you are on. You need
  the ground around you for resources.

  * You are a beaver. Your dam/home is made of logs. Enemies are trying to steal
    the logs and you have to protect/replace them.

* When you fail, the path you took is closed off.

* You are getting bigger. You have to escape before you get stuck.
